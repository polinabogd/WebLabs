CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages
Description: In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages (You can find the template of these pages by following the link)
Update/Delete operations are not required for this work!
Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).
If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.
Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.
Requirements:
●	Responsiveness absolutely not required.
●	Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.
```
```
Description: In the last part of working on the website you have to implement all Create/Read/Update/Delete operations which must be made via the corresponding HTTP methods in your REST API.
Important. You don't have to make a backend from the beginning - connect an existing one that you worked on in the first year.
If you don’t have a backend server, you should create a new REST API using any preferred technology.
