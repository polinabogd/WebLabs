# WebLabs

## Task
Using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations):
 # Sort of your items option
 # Seach option
 # Count total amount of some of the field

 - Responsiveness is absolutely not required
 - Styling is not important at all. It is up to you.
