# WebLabs
Requirements
Use of semantic tags (, ,
, , etc.) wherever is necessary
All fonts, colour palette, elements sizes must strictly match the design
Pixel perfect is also not required, BUT your website should visually match the design template (i.e. If the element is horizontally centred on the design, it should look centred on the website)
All class names must not be meaningless (i.e. class=”myClass”) andshould follow the same naming convention, preferably BEM, but you could come up with your own (just be consistent)
Basic cross-browser support (website should look correctly on last versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
For now, responsiveness is not required
